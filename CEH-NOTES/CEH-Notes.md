# üê± Common Terminologies

## Public key infrastructure (PKI)

A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.

## Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)

The Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) comprise a group of cryptographic standards that provide guidelines and application programming interfaces (APIs) for the usage of cryptographic methods. As the name PKCS suggests, these standards put an emphasis on the usage of public key (that is, asymmetric) cryptography.

## Active Directory forest (AD forest)

An Active Directory forest (AD forest) is the top most logical container in an Active Directory configuration that contains domains, users, computers, and group policies.

## Wired equivalent privacy (WEP)

Wired equivalent privacy is meant to protect Wi-Fi transmissions by encrypting the data so outsiders who are not inside the encrypted network will not be able to read the messages or data contained within. WEP is better than no security at all, and it is still used on older devices that do not support WPA or WPA2.

## Group Policy

Group Policy allows administrators to define security policies for users and for computers. These policies, which are collectively referred to as Group Policy Objects (GPOs), are based on a collection of individual Group Policy settings.

## Ad Hoc

An ad hoc network is a temporary type of Local A  rea Network (LAN). If you set up an ad hoc network permanently, it becomes a LAN.

## Banner Grabbing

Banner grabbing is a technique used to gain information about a computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports. Administrators can use this to take inventory of the systems and services on their network.
